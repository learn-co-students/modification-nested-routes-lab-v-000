#why do you not need the hidden field anymore with the artist id? (line 5)
#how can you actually create a brand new artist and add to db? with this implementation you are
limited to dropdown of artists even if you add a new one in the field. Seperate _form for edit/new?

#songs helper or artist helper? Helper file or model?
